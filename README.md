# MRI Temperature Correlation Analysis and Correction Model

This workflow provides an automated pipeline for exploring relationships between forehead temperature and MRI parameters in deep gray matter substructures.
The fitted linear models (intercept a and slope b) can be used to correct postmortem MRI parameters for temperature.

# Pipeline
This script processes MRI-derived metrics (**FA, MD, T1, T2, T2\***)
across deep gray matter regions and correlates them with forehead temperature
measurements taken during scanning.  

## Requirements
+ os
+ pandas
+ numpy
+ matplotlib.pyplot
+ seaborn
+ scipy.stats (linregress, pearsonr, t)
+ glob
+ matplotlib.lines (Line2D)
+ matplotlib.patches (mpatches)

## Features
- **Input**  
  - Subject-wise CSV outputs from NIfTI-based MRI analysis  
  - Excel file with corresponding forehead temperatures  

- **Processing**  
  - Merges MRI parameter data  
  - Maps MRI metrics to relevant temperature values  
  - Computes Pearson correlations, linear regressions, RÂ², slopes, and confidence intervals  

- **Output**  
  - Publication-ready scatter plots with regression lines (**PNG** & **SVG**)  
  - Summary table with correlation statistics (**CSV**)  
  - Standalone color-coded region legend  

## Customisation
- Adjustable input/output paths  
- Flexible grouping of brain structures  
- Configurable plot style and font sizes  

# Usage
+ Download the python script
+ Define the input paths where you have located your NIfTI files and excel containing the temperature data
+ Define the output paths where you want to save the summary table with correlation statistics and the plots
