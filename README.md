# MRI Temperature Correlation Analysis

This script processes MRI-derived metrics (**FA, MD, T1, T2, T2\***)
across deep gray matter regions and correlates them with forehead temperature
measurements taken during scanning.  

## Features
- **Input**  
  - Subject-wise CSV outputs from NIfTI-based MRI analysis  
  - Excel file with corresponding forehead temperatures  

- **Processing**  
  - Cleans and merges MRI parameter data (with corrected T1 support)  
  - Excludes unwanted regions (e.g., *Accumbens*)  
  - Maps MRI metrics to relevant temperature values  
  - Computes Pearson correlations, linear regressions, RÂ², slopes, and confidence intervals  

- **Output**  
  - Publication-ready scatter plots with regression lines (**PNG** & **SVG**)  
  - Summary table with correlation statistics (**CSV**)  
  - Standalone color-coded region legend  

## Customization
- Adjustable input/output paths  
- Flexible grouping of brain structures  
- Configurable plot style and font sizes

This workflow provides an automated pipeline for exploring relationships between physiological temperature and MRI signal characteristics in deep gray matter structures.
